    <p>
      With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person
      to hire when it comes to a full fledged project. Whatever your needs are,
      I can pretty much take on any challenge.

          Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users,
          solve problems and build great products.

          My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for
          design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole package.

        <p>Motion Design</p>
        <p>
          I started my design journey with motion design in my college days.
          Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the
          flexibility of story telling.

        <p>
          Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography
          really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.
